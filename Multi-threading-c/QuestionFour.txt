4a) A system call is a method by which a computer program requests services from the kernel of the operating system on which it is exectued. These calls provide a very important interface between a process and the operating system. A function call on the other hand is an expression that passes control and arguments to a function. This is a call made by a program to perform a specific task.
Context switching occurs between system calls where as there is no context switching between function calls. System calls allow a program to access memory or resources (hardware) from the kernel whereas, function calls help to pass the control to a specific function to exectue a defined task. 

4b) System calls are usually used with Gilbic Wrappers as this library already contains the required functional implementation. However, system calls can also be implemented without the use of these wrappers. sys/syscall.h header include can be added to a program to invoke the syscall function directly. This is less safe implmentation than wrappers however, it is possible to use system calls after this include without the wrappers. strace can be used to see they type of system calls required to perform specific functions and these can be individually implemented wihtout wrappers.
